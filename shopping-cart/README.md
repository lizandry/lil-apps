react refresh challenge

using some css code and static data from a shopping cart tutorial, i will create my own app using the PERN stack, in order to refresh my knowledge of the relevant technologies.

# PLANNED STEPS
1 - create basic client-side app structure and components with react
2 - refactor code to make it neater, easier-to-read and more modular
3 - create a server using node and express
4 - integrate auth0 login
5 - create a database containing tables for available products and user carts
6 - create a checkout function
7 - add new features as they come up, ex: store admins who can add and remove new products, splash page, accessibility features

might also dip out early, when i feel confident in my skills and want to start a new, typescript challenge. who knows! wish me luck
